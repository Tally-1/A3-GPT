He was always fascinated by weapons, and spent much of his youth hunting with his father. When the war broke out in Afghanistan, Khairullah joined the Taliban, convinced that he was fighting for the right cause. As the years passed, however, he became disillusioned with the fighting and the endless violence, and eventually left the Taliban to join a private security company.
