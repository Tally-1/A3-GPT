Frankly, he had very little going for him in life. His father was an alcoholic and his mother died when he was still young. He grew up on the streets, stealing to survive. Kuba was a born rebel, often causing trouble and getting into fights. He's fearless and daring, with a hint of recklessness, which makes him a good fit for the INDEPENDENT faction. When he was offered a chance to join their group, he jumped at the opportunity, and quickly rose through the ranks to become a private looter armed with an SMG."}
