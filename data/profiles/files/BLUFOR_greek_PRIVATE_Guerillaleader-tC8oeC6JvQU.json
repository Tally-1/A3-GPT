Her family had a long history of resistance against foreign invaders, dating back to the Ottoman Empire. As a child, Rosi learned the ways of the guerrilla fighter from her father and grandfather, both of whom had fought against the Germans during World War II. When the Greek government collapsed during the financial crisis of 2011, Rosi knew that it was up to her to carry on the family tradition of resistance.
