He's always cool-headed and takes pride in his craft. However, his true passion lies with his family - he works so hard in order to provide for his beloved wife and two young children, still living back in China. When he's not on mission, he's writing loving letters in elegant calligraphy to them. His one secret is that he is petrified of the sea and always insists on being ferried across only when necessary.","story":"Nianzu grew up in Guangdong, China, and was the eldest of four siblings. His father was a small-time electrician who could barely make do for the family, and often had to rely on some shady people to make ends meet. Growing up, there was never enough to eat, and the family often had to huddle together under blankets during winter. When he turned 18, Nianzu decided to join the military as a way out - he wanted to provide for his family, and it was his only chance to learn new things and explore the world. He was posted to a Recon unit in Chengdu, where his talent with explosives was discovered by his superior. Since then, he had been trained as a specialist with TMRs (Thermobaric rocket launcher), and had been sent on many successful missions. He had no idea when he would be reunited with his wife and children, but his love for them keeps his spirit going in battle."}
