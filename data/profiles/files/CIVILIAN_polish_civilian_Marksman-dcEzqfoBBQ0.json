He spent most of his childhood living in Warsaw, where he developed a love for the outdoors and spent much of his free time hiking and camping with friends. Robert's talent with a rifle earned him an invitation to join a local shooting club, which helped him refine his skills even further. When war broke out in his home country, Robert chose not to fight, but instead to use his marksmanship to protect his family and friends. Now, as a civilian marksman, he travels wherever he is needed to keep his loved ones safe."}
